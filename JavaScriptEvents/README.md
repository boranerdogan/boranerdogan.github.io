I used the starter files from the WRA 410 GitHub and worked within the existing separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. For my process, I focused on JavaScript event listeners by using W3Schools examples about event listeners and the event listener examples in the WRA 410 course notes. I used these to decide which basic events to use and how to connect them to simple UI elements.

I also talked with my friend Suleyman about what kinds of events could work for this assignment and which ones would be easiest to use.
