# README.md

First of all, I should say that I really enjoyed doing this assignment and learned things that I didn’t know before. The documents I used for help while doing the assignment were the CSS transition, flexbox, and media queries documents in the notes folder of the wra410 class examples repository. Aside from those, another website that I found very useful while doing this assignment was W3Schools. It has very good explanations and activities about all of these topics. Before doing the assignment, I brainstormed with Suleyman about which transitions we could use. I wanted to use different transitions in both files. In the Good CSS file, I wanted to change the background color on hover, while in the Bad CSS file, I wanted to change the font size and opacity. This assignment was especially helpful for me in terms of learning parts of flexbox that I didn’t know. While planning, I started with the CSS body first, and then continued by changing the navigation bar and the navigation content in order. I am sure that when we combine these transitions we created with CSS with our JavaScript functions in the future, we will be able to create some really great things, and I am looking forward to it.
